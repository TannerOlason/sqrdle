# sqrdle

This single page application is meant to be a themed version of a popular web game.
The key differences are that the themed 'words' are names of monster from a popular 
franchise, and in order to fulfill my joke, the length of the names chosen is six 
characters. 'sqrdle' could not be condensed much further, I'm afraid.

## Images
You will have to find your own fusion images for this project as they're not 
provided by pokeapi, nor do I plan to host them here in the future. 
See: /src/assets/data/monster_images.js for where to drop and what to name 
these files.
